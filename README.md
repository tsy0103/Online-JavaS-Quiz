# Online Java Quiz
 Challenge 4
This week’s challenge is to create a “online Java Script Quiz” with the function of:
1.	Time limited
2.	Detected if the answer is correct or wrong
3.	Record the score
4.	Able to clear the score.

The challenge I met and struggle is how I gonna record the score, and this is almost all the reason why I submitted this assignment late. Also, I believe there should be a short way to do the loop instead of write every question a loop. I’ll keep study it.
